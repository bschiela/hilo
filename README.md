9-card high-low
===============
High-low is a group game played according to the following rules:
* 9 cards are dealt face-up on the table
* a player selects a card on the table and guesses whether the next card from
  the deck will be "higher," "lower," or "draw" (suits are irrelevant); the
  next card is then dealt face-up over the selected card
* if incorrect, the selected stack is turned face down and the group incurs a
  punishment (or reward, depending on how you look at it)
* gameplay continues until the deck is exhausted (win) or all 9 stacks are
  face-down (lose)
